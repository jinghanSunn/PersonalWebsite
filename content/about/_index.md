I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate at [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Liansheng Wang](https://xmu-lswang.github.io/). Additionally, I am a visiting student at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Sotirios A. Tsaftaris](https://vios.science/team/tsaftaris). Since 2020, I have been an intern at [Tencent Youtu Jarvis Center](https://jarvislab.tencent.com/index-en.html), led by [Dr. Yefeng Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vAIECxgAAAAJ) (IEEE Fellow) and supervised by [Dr. Dong Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=njMpTPwAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research aims to advance medical image analysis using AI, striving for affordable and accurate medical decision-making. My recent focus includes 1) vision-language models, 2) few-shot learning, and 3) Diffusion-based generative AI.
